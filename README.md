This project implements a Music Recommendation System using item-based collaborative filtering with cosine similarity. It analyzes user–song interaction data (ratings or play counts) to identify similarities between songs and recommend new tracks based on a user’s listening history.

The system constructs a user–item matrix, computes song-to-song similarity, and generates personalized recommendations by aggregating similarity scores weighted by user preferences. Sparse matrix representations are used for efficient computation.

The project also outlines a content-based recommendation approach (conceptual), demonstrating how audio features or metadata can be incorporated to build more advanced or hybrid recommender systems.

This project serves as a practical introduction to recommender systems, similarity-based modeling, and personalization techniques using Python and scikit-learn.
